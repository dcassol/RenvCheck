**Description**
===============
This R package executes a series of checks to determine Biocluster compatibility.
This should be used by the Bioinformatics Core Facility to determine if a user's R environment is capable of running workshop code.
This package, if generalized enough, could potentially be used as a unit testing utility for any environment.


**Usage**
=========
From within an R session:
    ```
    library(RenvCheck)
    ```
That is it.
